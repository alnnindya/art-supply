# art-supply
Hello this is Aline's first repository on GitHub

:art: :girl:

This script i made in Android Studio. The script use Kotlin and programming language. Actually I made this to fulfil the last exam to graduate from Indosat Ooredo Digital Camp 2021, Android Developer beginner level. So if you install the application into your Android, the first thing you will see in your screen is splash. The splash showing name of the application, "Art Supply", and showing the loading and credited by me. The concept of the application is like an online shop. You can scrolling through your screen and choose what art supply you wanna buy. After you choose one of the supplies, you will see some explanation of what you gonna get from buying it and the price of the stuff. You can choose buy it or put it in the basket. Also there's About button, the button will bring you to screen showing the creatore of the apps (it's me ^^)
